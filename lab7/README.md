# SpringAI Task

This project is a hands-on task to explore the capabilities of Spring AI. The main goal is to create a Chat Service that
interacts with users and responds to their queries. The provided sample code includes basic structure and configuration
only. You need to implement the missing parts to make the application work as expected.

## Part 1: Chat Service with System Prompt

In the first part of the task, we will create a Chat Service that includes a system prompt. Users will be able to send
requests to the Chat Service and ask questions. The responses from the Chat Service will be influenced by the system
prompt.

## Part 2: Vector Database Support and Document Reader Service

In the second part of the task, we will extend the functionality of our application by adding vector database support.
We will also introduce a Document Reader Service that can read PDF documents and answer questions about the content of
these documents from the Chat Service.

By the end of this task, you will have a deeper understanding of how to use Spring AI to create interactive services and
handle complex tasks.
